/**
 * Batch-resolve the two pieces of per-card data that FeedPostCard would
 * otherwise self-fetch on mount — the viewer's saved/bookmark set and any
 * job opening linked to each post. Without this, a list of N cards fires
 * 2×N queries (one getSavedSet + one getByPostId each); this collapses
 * that to exactly two queries per list.
 *
 * Pass the resolved values into each FeedPostCard as
 *   savedInitial={savedSet.has(post.postId)}
 *   linkedOpening={openings.get(post.uuid) ?? null}
 * The card uses them and skips its own fetch; if a card is rendered
 * standalone (no props), it still self-fetches — fully backward compatible.
 *
 * Re-runs only when the set of post ids changes (keyed on a joined id
 * string), so appending a page issues just two more queries, not 2×N.
