import { lazy, ComponentType } from 'react'

/**
 * Drop-in replacement for React.lazy that survives a failed dynamic import.
 *
 * The #1 cause of "the page just sits on a spinner and never loads" in a
 * deployed SPA: a new build changes every code-split chunk's content-hashed
 * filename, so a tab that was open across a deploy requests an OLD chunk URL
 * that no longer exists → the import() rejects → <Suspense> hangs forever.
 * (A transient network blip on the chunk fetch does the same.)
 *
 * Strategy:
 *  1. Try the import.
 *  2. On failure, wait briefly and retry once (covers a one-off network hiccup).
 *  3. If it still fails, force a single full reload so the browser fetches the
 *     fresh chunk manifest. A sessionStorage timestamp guards against reload
 *     loops when the failure is genuine (e.g. truly offline) — at most one
 *     auto-reload per 10s, after which we surface the error to the ErrorBoundary.
